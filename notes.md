sprintf-js it makes it easy to write slick configuration files with variable replacement.

inquirer is for writing CLI apps. It makes prompting people for information soooo slick.

backoff, for exponential and fibonacci backoffs for retrying whatever intermittently failing service you're using.

standard-error, for making custom error classes.

nearley, which I've mentioned in other contexts, for parsing using the Earley algorithm.

bistre for json logging

bole is just a neat little json logger that does exactly what it turns out that you want

must for testing assertions

p-promise is a lesser-known promise library that is small, good-performing, and covers the right subset of the full Q api. It's A+ promise compliant, but not a giant unwieldy thing.

dashdash is an options parser that doesn't get the press of optimist/minimist/yargs, etc, but it also does what you need from an options parser

if you like jade templates, `blade` has the same clean, beautiful syntax, but a better feature set.

stackup is the current best long stacktrace module, and sometimes I really need to figure out what's going on across async boundaries

replify + replpad, because what program isn't improved by having a Node REPL shoved into it?

json, because everybody needs a JSON swiss army knife

shimmer, because I do a lot of monkeypatching and want it to be as safe as is practicable
